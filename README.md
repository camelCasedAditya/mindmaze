# MindMaze - Puddletown Chess Homework Helper

This website allows chess instructors to send chess puzzles to students as homework. 
The chess instructor can create a puzzle and then select the student level (class) to which he wants to send it to.
All the students at that chess level will receive the chess puzzle in their puzzles tab and then can take three attempts to answer it.
If the user does not solve the puzzle in three attempts the correct answer will be displayed with an explanation
The students have a dashboard showing them the total number of puzzles they have solved and the number of puzzles solved correctly and incorrectly.
Students can always go back to the puzzle they have solved to see more of what they answered and why they were right or wrong.
